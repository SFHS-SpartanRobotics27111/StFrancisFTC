# St. Francis FTC Code

Team code for St. Francis

# Setting up

-   Make sure the Gradle Runtime (Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment >
    Build Tools > Gradle) is set to JetBrains Runtime 17.X.X. If it isn't, make
    sure to download that JDK from the same dropdown.
-   Do not upgrade Gradle or the Android Gradle Plugin if Android Studio prompts
    you to.

# Git Best Practices

-   Fetch and pull before you push to avoid merge conflicts.
-   All features should be developed in their own branches and merged into main
    once they are done. The main branch should always be buildable and in a
    working order
-   Double check the files changed before you commit, especially any
    configuration files, as Android Studio can change them without telling you.
